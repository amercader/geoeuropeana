Europeana API Geo-Wrapper
=========================

Adri√† Mercader - http://amercader.net

A thin wrapper around the Europeana API that transforms the results 
feed in a GeoRSS. It also includes a demo application that uses the 
geo wrapper to perform spatial queries. 

It was built during the first [Europeana Hackathon][eurohack].

Interesting bits:
